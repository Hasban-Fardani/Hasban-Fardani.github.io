[{"content":"What is Documentation Documentation, in short, is the process of collecting, managing, and storing information, source.\nIn the programming world, programmers usually use it to explain the code they have created, whether it\u0026rsquo;s per code block or project documentation. This greatly helps programmers communicate among teams. Imagine writing code with several people simultaneously where they each have their own thoughts; it would be difficult without specific guidelines on how a code operates. Additionally, documentation can serve as a reminder for developers so they don\u0026rsquo;t forget how their own code works.\nWhy it\u0026rsquo;s important As explained earlier, this is very important because it has many benefits, including being a \u0026lsquo;guidebook\u0026rsquo; and a reminder for the code they write. Without it, people might not understand, and even the programmer themselves might forget why they wrote the code that way in the first place.\nTypes of Documentation Here are some types of documentation commonly used by developers:\nCode Documentation: This includes comments within the source code that explain functionality, algorithms, and implementation details. Code documentation helps other developers or even oneself in the future understand how the code works.\nAPI Documentation: This documentation explains how to use the created API, including a list of functions, required parameters, and expected responses.\nDesign Documentation: This documentation provides an overview of software structure, data flow diagrams, and system design. It helps developers understand software concepts and architecture.\nUser Documentation: These are documents for end users that explain how to use the software, including user guides, tutorials, and FAQs.\nProject Documentation: This documentation covers everything related to project management, such as project plans, schedules, and status reports.\nRequirements Documentation: This includes documents that describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the software to be developed.\n","permalink":"https://hasban-fardani.github.io/blog/why-documentation-is-important-for-developer/","summary":"What is Documentation Documentation, in short, is the process of collecting, managing, and storing information, source.\nIn the programming world, programmers usually use it to explain the code they have created, whether it\u0026rsquo;s per code block or project documentation.

Hugo is similar to jekyll and 11ty. Due to its use of Go, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s performance is very high; it can generate a page in just milliseconds. Imagine having a blog with over 10,000 posts, and it only takes about 2 seconds to build! Moreover, the output is HTML files, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to pay for hosting space because GitHub Pages is sufficient.\nHowever, not only because of its performance, Hugo has a powerful Content Management System (CMS) feature. You only need to write in markdown format, and Hugo will automatically convert it to HTML files with dynamic data inside.\nHugo also has other cool features such as taxonomy, internationalization,\nExamples of Websites Using HUGO cloudflare documentation fireship.io petanikode.com hasban.site Why I Choose Hugo? Lightweight and fast Nowadays, web and application development is not just about making it work, but now we have to pay attention to the quality and performance of the web/application we create, this is due to the development of technology. Outputs static files With static file output, it makes it easy for developers to host the website, plus no complicated server-side configurations are needed. Good and growing community Currently, Hugo has been used by at least 1.3k developers, with 71.2k stars on its GitHub repository. Many free hosting options Yes, because it\u0026rsquo;s static, you can host it anywhere, even GitHub Pages alone is enough, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with github actions, you can use alternatives like netlify, vercel, and cloudflare pages. That\u0026rsquo;s all from me, hopefully, it\u0026rsquo;s useful.\n","permalink":"https://hasban-fardani.github.io/blog/hugo-static-web-generator-tercepat/","summary":"Hugo is the fastest Static Site Generator (SSG) because it is built with the Go programming language.
